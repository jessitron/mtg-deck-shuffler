# Animations Interactions

## Depends On

- **GameState / WhatHappened**: `src/GameState.ts` defines `WhatHappened` interface. Animation classes are chosen based on its properties. If `WhatHappened` changes, `getAnimationClassHelper()` must be updated to match.
- **HTMX**: Animations depend on HTMX swap behavior. The `swap:1.5s` delay for exit animations is an HTMX feature. Changes to HTMX version or swap configuration affect animation timing.
- **View rendering**: `shared-components.ts` applies animation classes during HTML generation. Changes to card rendering (container structure, class names, nesting) can break CSS selectors that target animated elements.
- **Two-faced cards**: The flip animation uses `.flip-container-outer`, `.flip-container-inner`, `.card-flipped`. Changes to two-faced card DOM structure will break flip animations and potentially break `.being-played` targeting (see `e904a8c` fix).

## Depended On By

- **Game page**: All gameplay animations render through `formatActiveGameHtmlSection()` and `formatCardContainer()`.
- **Prep page**: Card flip animation is reused on the prep/deck review page (duplicate CSS in `prepare.css`).
- **Deck selection page**: Tile fade-in animation is self-contained in `deck-selection.css`.

## Watch Points

- **Card container DOM structure**: The `.being-played` class is added to `.card-container` by JS. If the container class name or nesting changes, `game.js` line 96 (`button.closest(".card-container")`) will fail to find it.
- **hx-swap timing**: If `hx-swap="outerHTML swap:1.5s"` in `game-modals.ts:73` or `revealed-cards-components.ts:57` is changed, exit animation timing breaks.
- **CSS class names in WhatHappened mapping**: `getAnimationClassHelper()` in `shared-components.ts:115-127` returns specific class name strings. These must match the CSS exactly.
- **Drag-and-drop cleanup**: `game.js` lines 183-186 remove specific animation class names. If new animation classes are added, they may need to be cleaned up here too.
- **Duplicate flip CSS**: Card flip styles exist in both `game.css` (lines 104-142) and `prepare.css` (lines 221-256). Changes to one must be mirrored in the other.

## Not Related To

- **Library search modal**: Uses `#modal-container` but has no animations of its own (no transitions on open/close). The "Search" button itself is not animated.
- **Observability/tracing**: `hny.js` contains a `shimmer` module but that's OpenTelemetry instrumentation internals, not the CSS shimmer animation.
- **Card data/adapters**: Deck loading, MTGJSON/Archidekt adapters — these supply card data but have no animation involvement.
