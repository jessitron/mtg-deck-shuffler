# Make the URL in the browser point back to the game

When we create a game, we want the URL in the browser to reflect that. For instance, if the game ID is 12345, we want the URL to be https://librarytron.com/game/12345

Likewise, when we end the game, we want the URL to revert to the default.

If the player copies the URL to a different browser, it should load all the state for that game, and let them continue playing.

Please put an implementation plan here:
