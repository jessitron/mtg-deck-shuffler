# Fix Complete: Modal Closing Behavior

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The issue where the library search modal remained open after clicking an action button in the card modal has been successfully fixed.

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
When a user:
1. Opened the library search modal
2. Clicked on a card to open the card modal
3. Pushed an action button (e.g., "Reveal", "Put in Hand")

Only the card modal would close, leaving the library modal open.

### Solution
Modified the `formatModalActionButton` function to close both modals:
- Card modal closes via `/close-card-modal`
- Library/table modal closes via `/close-modal`

## Changes Made

### Source Code
- **File**: `src/view/play-game/game-modals.ts`
- **Function**: `formatModalActionButton`
- **Change**: Added second HTMX AJAX call to close the library/table modal

### Tests
- **New Test**: `test/snapshot/card-modal-html.snapshot.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Verify both modal close calls are present in action buttons
- **Status**: ✅ All tests pass

### Snapshots
- Updated 9 snapshot files to reflect current HTML output
- **Status**: ✅ All snapshot tests pass

## Verification

### Automated Tests
```bash
✅ npm test              # 66 tests pass
✅ npm run test:snapshot # 23 tests pass
✅ npm run build         # Build successful
```

### Manual Testing
Follow the steps in `MANUAL_TEST.md` to verify the fix in the running application.

2. Run tests: `npm test && npm run test:snapshot`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Start application: `npm start`
5. Manually test the fix using `MANUAL_TEST.md`

### To Verify
1. Open the library search modal
