# History

## How the typography got settled

The most consistent thing in the app was arrived at by subtraction, not decree.

- `38ffc70` **Game page fonts: drop Rampart One, use Ovo for body, Orbitron for fancy
  titles** — the decisive commit. The app had accumulated four or five faces; this cut it
  to two with clear jobs.
- `d1ba518` **Add Orbitron font to game page for card modal titles** — extends Orbitron
  into the play pages' chrome.
- `e41045d` **Make the buttons the body font** — an earlier pass in the other direction.
- Risque arrived with the marketing pages and stayed confined to them
  (`index.ejs` and `choose-any-deck.ejs` are the only views that request it).

The lesson encoded in the current rule — Orbitron for chrome, Ovo for content, Risque for
splash — is that it was *won*, and adding a fourth face reopens a settled question.

## How the tokens got started

- `5876f89` **Move mana colors to CSS custom properties** — the mana set was the first
  deliberate tokenisation, and it's the only *complete* one: five colors, closed set, all
  used through `var()`.
- `17c5931` **Extract shared button styles into button-base class** — the same instinct
  applied to buttons, and the origin of the signature `10px outset var(--light-pink)` CTA.

Both show the pattern working. What didn't happen was extending it to the rest of the
palette, which is why there are still 57 hex values.

## The abandoned prescriptive attempt — read this before writing design rules

There is an unmerged branch, **`attempt-to-bring-in-designers`** (4 commits, June 2026,
never merged to `main`), that tried to solve this problem the other way round: three
"design persona" skills channelling named designers.

- `1a53705` **Turn the three design-persona DESIGN docs into invokable skills** — added
  `rasmus-ui-design` (Rasmus Andersson, UI), `ilya-birman-typography` (Ilya Birman,
  typography), and `maxime-heckel-animation` (Maxime Heckel, animation) in
  `notes/design-personas/`, symlinked into `.claude/skills/`.
- `731d32d` **Reframe animation skill: HTMX+CSS today, Framer Motion as future tabletop**
- `7336d4e` **Add scope-reality banners to the UI and typography persona skills** — the
  tell. Both docs had to be prefaced with a warning that they described an app that
  doesn't exist:
  - `rasmus-ui-design` assumed a shared multiplayer god-view canvas with draggable cards,
    zones, life trackers, counters, tokens, and an AI suggestion layer — none of which the
    Shuffler has.
  - `ilya-birman-typography` prescribed Cinzel/Inter and "one sans-serif only", directly
    contradicting the shipped Orbitron/Ovo/Risque identity.

The branch was abandoned. **The failure was structural, not a matter of picking better
designers:** the docs were written from what a card-game UI *should* be, so they described
a different app, and the first honest maintenance pass on them was a banner saying "none
of this is true yet." Advice that contradicts the running app gets ignored, and advice
that gets ignored is worse than none — it costs a consult every time.

That's why this owner is **descriptive first**. The rules in
[README.md](README.md) are all read off the actual CSS, and the gallery at `/design`
renders specimens with the app's own stylesheets precisely so the knowledge base cannot
drift into that failure mode again.

Worth noting: the animation persona survived contact better than the other two (it was
reframed, not bannered), and its concerns are now covered by the **animations** owner.

## How the drift accumulated

No single commit is at fault, which is the point. The pattern visible in the log is a
feature landing with a button, the button needing a color, and a Material or Bootstrap
default going in because it was at hand. The card modal's seven action buttons — play,
put-in-hand, put-on-top, put-on-bottom, flip, recover, gatherer — are the clearest
sediment: seven unrelated Material hues, none of them brand colors, each added when its
action was added.

The "square corners" rule was written into `apps/shuffler/CLAUDE.md` at some point and is
honored by everything recent — the join-table panel (`JES-127`), the hamburger menu, the
at-table banner all carry explicit "square corners" comments. Everything older doesn't.
So the rule works when it's known; it just wasn't discoverable enough.

## 2026-08-01 — this owner, and the gallery

- `970b08d` **Add /design, a component gallery rendered by the app's own CSS** — the
  inventory made tangible. Renders every component with the app's real stylesheets, tags
  each section standard / choose-one / drift, and stages six open decisions with both (or
  three) options side by side. Includes both Josh Comeau 3D-button variants: the faithful
  three-span `.pushable` and the drop-in `.pushable-flat`, which reproduces the travel and
  spring easing from a hard `box-shadow` so no markup changes.
- Jess's standing decision, made when this owner was created: **new UI pulls toward the
  standard**, rather than matching whatever drift it sits next to. Accepts a temporarily
  mixed look in exchange for convergence.
