# Manual Test: Verify Library Modal Closes After Card Action

## Test Scenario
This test verifies that when a user opens the library search modal, clicks on a card to open the card modal, and then pushes an action button, both modals close properly.

## Prerequisites
1. Start the application: `npm start`
2. Navigate to the application in a browser
3. Create or load a game with cards in the library

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Library Card → Reveal Action
1. Click the "Library" button to open the library search modal
2. Verify the library modal is displayed with a list of cards
3. Click on any card name in the library list
4. Verify the card modal opens, showing the card details
5. Click the "Reveal" button in the card modal
6. **Expected Result**: Both the card modal AND the library modal should close
7. **Expected Result**: The card should now appear in the revealed area

### Test 2: Library Card → Put in Hand Action
1. Click the "Library" button to open the library search modal
2. Click on any card name in the library list
3. Verify the card modal opens
4. Click the "Put in Hand" button in the card modal
5. **Expected Result**: Both the card modal AND the library modal should close
6. **Expected Result**: The card should now appear in your hand

### Test 3: Verify Other Modals Work Similarly
1. Click the "Table" button to open the table modal (if you have cards on the table)
2. Click on any card name in the table list
3. Verify the card modal opens
4. Click any action button (e.g., "Return")
5. **Expected Result**: Both the card modal AND the table modal should close

## Success Criteria
- ✅ After clicking an action button in the card modal, both modals close
- ✅ The action is performed correctly (card moves to the expected location)
- ✅ No modals remain open after the action
- ✅ The game state updates correctly

## Before the Fix
Before this fix, only the card modal would close, leaving the library/table modal open. This was confusing because:
- The user had to manually close the library modal
- It wasn't clear if the action had been performed
- The modal obscured the updated game state

## After the Fix
After this fix, both modals close automatically, providing a clean user experience where:
- The action is clearly completed
- The user can immediately see the updated game state
- No manual cleanup is required
